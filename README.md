# CoinCalc3.0
This package is an Update of the CoinCalc package by Siegmund et al. 2017. The code was improved and new functionality was added. 
The package supplies functions to compute the Event Coincidence of two timeseries or also of a series of pairs of timeseries. 
Furthermore there are now functions to compute coupled amplitude adjusted Fourrier transformation surrogates, 
to visualize the significance in a Receiver Operating Characteristics Analysis and to compute event synchronization rates 
as addition to the ECA.
